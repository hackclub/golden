### The Dinner
The night before the hackathon, we had an amazing Women in Tech dinner where 10 mentors shared their inspirational stories and invaluable advice. We parted with newfound insights, Linkdens, and lots of leftovers. Special thanks to Tom Preston-Werner for providing us with the venue, The Light House in SF, and being such a gracious host!

### The Hackathon

On Saturday, we hosted our hackathon and all attendees participated in 4 workshops and created 3 final projects each!

The AI workshop by Kayla Zhang using the AI Game in 40 Lines jam helped participants create a haunted house escape room ðŸ˜± and customize it to make their own games. Kayla also ran a DS workshop in which attendees visualized data and analyzed data they made.

The web dev workshop by Sarah and Audrey Wang guided participants through creating personal websites and got a bunch of bobaðŸ§‹thanks to boba drops! Thank you 
sampoder for helping out with the webdev workshop and coming to our event! 

Audrey also hosted an intro to A-frame workshop.

Reva also hosted a mini 3D printing workshop and attendees CADed golden rings on Onshape that were later 3D printed.

One of the best parts of the event was lunchtime, where our mentors were mingling with attendees and sharing their wisdom :pizza:

#### Workshops

## Theme, Decor, Merch
For theme colors, we used a color scheme generator to determine the official colors of Golden. There were many drafts made for the official Orpheus mascot of Golden, but we settled on a very chunky, cute Orpheus with a golden crown. For decor, we ordered yellow balloons and streamers. For merchandise, we ordered jackets for the team which included the Orpheus design on the back with the word "Golden" and a crown on the front.
